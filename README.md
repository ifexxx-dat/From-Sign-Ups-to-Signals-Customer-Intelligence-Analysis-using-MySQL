From Sign-Ups to Signals: Customer Intelligence Analysis in MySQL
 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a cleaned U.S. customer dataset using MySQL to uncover actionable business insights. After performing extensive data cleaning to address duplicates, inconsistent entries, and formatting issues, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand customer demographics, acquisition channels, device usage, and signup trends.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how structured SQL queries can be used to support data-driven decision-making in a business environment.

 Problem Statement
Customer data is often underutilized despite its potential to drive growth and improve marketing strategies. This project aims to transform raw customer records into meaningful insights by answering key business questions such as:

Who are the customers?

Where are they located?

How do they find the business?

How do demographics and behavior vary across segments?

All analysis was performed using MySQL, simulating a real-world analytics workflow.

 Dataset Description
 The dataset contains customer information for a U.S.-based business.

Key Columns:

CustomerID

FirstName

LastName

Email

Date_of_Birth

Sign_Up_Date

Phone_Number

Gender

Address

City

State

Country (United States only)

Device_ID

Source (customer acquisition channel)

Tools & Technologies

MySQL – Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis

SQL – Aggregations, filtering, grouping, subqueries, and date functions

GitHub – Version control and project documentation

Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA was structured around simple, intermediate, and advanced business questions, including:

Customer distribution by city and state

Gender and age demographics

Signup trends over time

Acquisition source performance

Device usage patterns

Age segmentation across marketing channels

A total of 20 SQL-driven analytical questions were answered to uncover patterns and trends relevant to marketing and customer strategy.

Key Insights (Summary)

Customer acquisition is concentrated in a few key states and cities.

Certain acquisition sources consistently outperform others.

Younger customers tend to come from specific channels.

Signup activity shows noticeable trends over time.

Device usage varies across customer segments.

(Detailed SQL queries and results are available in the repository.)

What I Learned

How to structure SQL queries for exploratory analysis

Translating business questions into analytical queries

Using MySQL date functions for age and trend analysis

Writing readable and reusable SQL for real-world datasets

Documenting analytical work clearly for non-technical audiences

I am a pharmacy student transitioning into data analytics, with a strong interest in using data to solve business problems. I am currently building hands-on projects using SQL, Python, and other analytics tools to prepare for junior roles in data analytics.
